<!-- _Monitoring_ - We believe the connectivity issues are being caused by an isolated ISP issue. We've had reports that swapping to Google DNS servers (see here; https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/using) resolves the problem for users. {{< track "2018-05-25 04:40:00" >}} -->

_Investigating_ - We're aware of kaleyra being down, we are working on communicating with kaleyra team to resolve this as soon as possible.
